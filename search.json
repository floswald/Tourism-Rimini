    "text": "Dear Students,\nDear Directors of the Study Programs,\nMy esteemed Colleagues,\nLadies and Gentlemen in the audience,\nIt’s a pleasure to share some thoughts with you today on the topic of Tourism and Economics in general - and Urban Economics in particular. Your study programs here at the Rimini campus of the University of Bologna provides you with excellent foundations to study this exciting intersection of topics, and I would like to congratulate the program directors for setting up and running this degree, and I would like to congratulate all of you on a good choice of study area.\nI want to start this talk with a general overview of tourism in a historical perspective, so that we remind ourselves where the phenomenon originates. I want to then talk about the importance of tourism in a macroeconomic sense, so that we get an idea of the magnitudes which are at stake - which differ in different areas, but can be quite sizeable. This is certainly the case for Italy, but it is true in many other countries as well. From the macroeconomy, I will then zoom in on a few critical issues that have to do with mass tourism. I will consider in particular issues and tensions in Cities."

    "text": "The Path to Mass Tourism\nNowadays, tourism is a mass phenomenon. Everybody knows what it is, and my guess that everybody in this room has made experiences over their lifetimes that we would call “tourism”. Let’s quickly look at the evolution fo this phenomenon over time, and how we went from vacations for kings to vacations for everyone.\n\n\n\nOur World in Data, Herre and Samborska (2023)\n\n\n\nWe can see that after WW2, tourism measured by international overnight stays was still in its infancy. This is partly due to very expensive airfares but mainly to few resources to spend on leisure in a world destroyed by war. People around the world were busy rebuilding their economies and livelihoods: They had no time, no money, and probably no interest to go on vacation.\nThen we see a gradual but constant increase in the amount of tourist trips. We can see how different destinations fared over time. Europe is the most sought after destination (that includes Europeans within Europe).\nThe trend is nothing but striking. It is not difficult to imagine how to extend this graph to the right. Of course we all know what the graph looks like just 3 years out and into 2021, when the COVID19 pandemic reset tourism to a level of zero. Apart from such incidents, and looking at data like this, the UN World Tourism Organization estimated in 2004 that this would grow at an annual rate of 4%. We call this shape commonly exponential growth - each year we seem to outperform the growth from last year.\nThis pattern reflects what we see in overall living standards across the globe.\nLet’s look at this:\n\n\n\n\nOur World in Data, Herre and Samborska (2023)\n\n\nSo, it is fair to say that the advent of mass tourism is the result of two forces. On the on hand technological progress led to cheaper means of transport and a decline in travel costs, which together with more tourism infrastructure reduces prices. On the other hand, continued increases in living standards allowed always more and more people to be able to afford a vacation. The next graph makes this point nicely for the year 2022:\n\n\n\nOur World in Data, Herre and Samborska (2023)\n\n\n\nHere we can clearly see that the higher the living standard (measured by GDP per capita) in a country, the higher the average number of international departures for tourism.\nLet me highlight a few things here which are important to interpret this correctly\n\nThis is a log scale, meaning the distances on the y axis increase.\nThis is about international tourism. Basically, Italy has only half of Bulgaria’s departures because many Italians do vacation in their own country.\nGoing towards the left on the income scale, we see that the number of international tourist trips collapses rapidly.\nIt seems evident from this graph that money buys many things, quite obviously, and among those it buys vacations abroad.\n\nTo sum up, while we have seen a huge increase in the number of tourist trips over the last 70 years, in line with impressive increases in living standards."

However, the big picture looks somewhat like the following.\n\n\n\nOur World in Data, Herre and Samborska (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\nOur World in Data, Herre and Samborska (2023)\n\n\n\nTourism is an important share of some countries overall gross product.\nWhat are some implications for government policy?"

    "text": "Government Policy\n\nTourism is a vital part of income for many poor countries. There are many problems associated with intensive tourism in poor countries, but it can be a valid strategy to start developing faster. It all depends on the how not on the if it is done. There are many scare stories about resource-rich countries who were ruined by corruption and mis-management. We call it the natural resource curse. Basically, don’t sell off everything you have, and at once.\nHow much should a government of a rich OECD country like Italy try to sustain the tourism sector with specific investment and subsidies?\nThis is a thorny question to answer in a room full of current and future experts of the Tourism Industry. So let me try and be careful now.\nIn general, if we would advise to enact industrial policy at all, and help certain sectors rather than others, the common advice is to invest in sectors with high growth potential. This concerns in particular areas where we hope to become more productive or more efficient. For example, by producing the same amount of output with lower cost, or by producing more but at constant cost.\nNow, I told you before that tourism is expected to grow at 4% per year. There are only few other sectors that are expected to grow at this rate. It seems wrong for any government confronted with those numbers not to invest in this sector in some way.\nThis is true, and nobody right in their mind would suggest to shut down tourism. But - and that’s a big but - one must recognize that tourism is subject to a some very clear and stringent physical limits which question this idea of the sector of the future. Tourism - to say it in the language of 2025 - does not scale well. What do I mean by that?\n\nTourism involves visiting physical locations. (it’s not like watching movies via a streaming service where I can serve as many customers as I want without any physical limit).\nThe physical world is limited - there are only so many locations on this planet (worth visiting). Once the location is full of visitors, nobody else can enter.\nThis notion of physical constraints is becoming more salient recently. There is a concept called overtourism. The idea of “well, we can always add another hotel”, or “we can always add another skilift”, or “we can always add a few rows to this beach club (stabilimento)” is running up against more and more resistance.\nSpace is limited, and (local and global) jurisdictions need to decide what to do with that space. It’s a complex problem, because often we have a public resource (a mountain, a beach, or some other landscape) and need to decide if and how to exploit it. There are many competing interests.\nAll of this to say: from a government’s prospective, each Euro I invest in one sector, I do not invest in another sector. From this point of view, the bulk of investment should go to other things like R+D in general and high-tech (biotech) in particular. There are many nuances to this statement, and it will apply to different degrees in different countries and circumstances."

    "text": "Labor Markets\n\nA related issue is that next to space, labor is one of the main inputs into tourism : chef, waiter, ski instructor, yoga trainer, bus driver etc. Each of those can only produce a finite number of meals/skiing/yoga lessons etc. Those jobs don’t scale.\nPeople need jobs. The 2023 edition of EUROSTATs Tourism Satellite Accounts estimates that there are 4.5 million jobs in tourism in Italy.\nThere are issues with the quality of jobs in this sector. Weak growth in wages (italy in particular) because of no or too little competition."

    "text": "Tourists in Cities\n\nIn cities, the problem is similar to mountains and beaches. We don’t have public space to allocate, but private space: In a bed where a tourist sleeps, nobody else can sleep. In particular, no local resident can sleep there - except of course in rare cases where they sleep in one bed together, but this is not the subject of our concerns here. So, if it is difficult to build new housing for locals at the same rate as tourism increases, then there is an obvious shortage of space.\nWith strong growth in Urban Tourism, what are the issues that cities face ?\nPolicy makers need to confront a conflict between beneficiaries and people who only suffer from tourism in cities.\nThe proper response will take a stand on what is regarded as fair in some way. However, to make good policy, it is crucial to have a good understanding of the magnitudes at play.\nIn particular: We may all agree that the arrival of Airbnb (et al) in a city most likely would increase rental prices, the crucial question is - by how much?\nWhat would rent have been in area xyz, had airbnb never happened?"
