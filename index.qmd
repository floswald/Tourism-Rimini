## A Brief History of Tourism: How It All Started

[NYT article from 2008:](https://archive.nytimes.com/frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/lesons-from-the-frugal-grand-tour/) 

> Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-Oxbridge trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of Western civilization. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they commissioned paintings, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.

## Government Policy

<br>

::: {.incremental}

* The Natural Resource Curse in Poor Countries.

* Tourism Policy in rich OECD countries?

* Is Tourism a *Growth Sector*?

* What about Labor Markets in Tourism?

* So, how can we grow tourism then?

## Some Issues with Mass Tourism

<br>

1. The problem of the commons: A publicly available resource will be depleted by profit maximizing entrepreneurs if not regulated in some way. Think of beaches or ski resorts.
3. Higher rental prices in cities.
4. Noise. Congestion.
5. Overtourism in general: is there a middle way between becoming *Disneyland* and no tourism revenues at all? How stringent should limits on mass tourism be? How to decide?


## Tourists in Cities


::: {.incremental}


<br>

* We must decide on an allocation of space for different uses.
* Growth in Urban Tourism expected very strong.
* Policy makers must confront the critical tradeoffs: You cannot make everybody happy here.

## The Arrival of Platform Capitalism in our Cities

<br>

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
::: {.fragment}
* Airbnb, Uber, Deliveroo, Lime etc
* Digital Platform acting as a *match maker*
* Conflict with other (traditional) forms of business.
* Many different approaches and layers to regulation.

### Airbnb Interest Groups

1. Airbnb
2. Associations of "home sharers" (hosts)
3. The hotel industry
4. Residents' associations
5. *Sharing economy* advocates
6. Corporate platforms

## Airbnb in The City

## Why Measuring Airbnb Impact on Rents is Difficult

<br>

* We typically have data on long term rental rates next to the number of airbnb listings in a certain area of a city.
* We see airbnb's increase, and we see rents increase. 
* Is this evidence that airbnb *caused* rents to go up?
* What if some city area is gentrifying (i.e. improving), thus getting more interesting for locals *and* for airbnb tourists at the same time?

@https://doi.org/10.3982/ECTA21394 find:

* Young Amsterdam residents are compensated for the rent increases by new amenities which they find interesting (bars, restaurants)
* Older Amsterdam residents loose out.

* Do tourists ruin locals' experience of amenities?  
* People talking too loudly at the next table?
* This study uses Terrorism and COVID shocks to see whether restaurant reviews get better as no tourists are around.

# Summary

::: {.incremental}

1. Tourism for the masses is a sign of prosperity and wellbeing.
2. Mass Tourism also poses challenges for (local/global) jurisdictions: Space is limited, and we must regulate (market does not solve the problem!).
3. Formulating policy responses requires precise measurement of effects.
4. The effects are nuanced, localized, but significant.
5. Much work remains to be done. ðŸ‘‰ Your turn!
