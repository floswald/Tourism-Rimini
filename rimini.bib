	abstract = {In this paper, we assess the impact of Airbnb on housing rents and prices in the city of Barcelona. Examining very detailed data on rents and both transaction and posted prices, we use several econometric approaches that exploit the exact timing and geography of Airbnb activity in the city. These include i) panel fixed-effects models, where we run multiple specifications that allow for different forms of heterogeneous time trends across neighborhoods, ii) an instrumental variables shift-share approach in which tourist amenities predict where Airbnb listings will locate and Google searches predict when listings appear, iii) event-study designs, and iv) finally, we present evidence from Sagrada Familia, a major tourist amenity that is not found in the city centre. Our main results imply that for the average neighborhood, Airbnb activity has increased rents by 1.9%, transaction prices by 4.6% and posted prices by 3.7%. The estimated impact in neighborhoods with high Airbnb activity is substantial. For neighborhoods in the top decile of Airbnb activity distribution, rents are estimated to have increased by 7%, while increases in transaction (posted) prices are estimated at 17% (14%).},

	abstract = {Tourism in cities fosters social interactions between people from distant cultures within limited space. But how does the influx of tourists affect locals' satisfaction with amenities? Using data on restaurant reviews, we construct a panel of tourist presence in Paris. Based on two unanticipated drops in tourism -- the November 2015 terrorist attack and the COVID-19 pandemic -- we show that tourism reduces Parisians' satisfaction with restaurants. We find that social frictions, including xenophobia towards tourists, drive our results. As tourist numbers declined, explicit complaints about tourists in reviews decreased, while other complaints remained unaffected. Locals are least satisfied with dining among tourists from countries with weak social ties to France. Tourists are not affected by the presence of other tourists.},

	abstract = {<p>This paper shows the endogeneity of amenities plays a crucial role in determining the welfare distribution of a city's residents. We quantify this mechanism by building a dynamic model of residential choice with heterogeneous households, where consumption amenities are the equilibrium outcome of a market for non‐tradables. We estimate our model using Dutch microdata and leveraging variation in Amsterdam's spatial distribution of tourists as a demand shifter, finding significant heterogeneity in residents' preferences over amenities and in the supply responses of amenities to changes in demand composition. This two‐way heterogeneity dictates the degree of horizontal differentiation across neighborhoods, residential sorting, and inequality. Finally, we show the distributional effects of mass tourism depend on this heterogeneity: following rent increases due to growing tourist demand for housing, younger residents---whose amenity preferences are closest to tourists---are compensated by amenities tilting in their favor, while the losses of older residents are amplified.</p>},
